This shader let you add 3 textures over a base texture, with different offset, scales and alpha (Same alpha for 3).
You can add normal maps to add details over your textures.
For Randomize the scales and offset you need to add Texture Overlay Handler in you script
this has a boolean flag with will let you randomize when the game initialize. 
If you want to use this randomize feature you can use from the context menu of the script and 
call the Randomize method. You can get an warning from Unity but nothing to worried. 
More details in the code.

Feel free to modify this shader.
The textures in this package are from a free asset in the unity asset store called Blood splatter decal package
Thank you for use this shader
